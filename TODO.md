* Remove placeholders
* Write documentation
* Fix foodcritic alerts
* Test base provider with a different than default user
* rename system_user attribute to system_group or whatever that sounds more relevant to the attribute role.
* Write function that will check validness of hostname
* Refactor internal providers so there will be no chain of attributes hand over, like it done in application cookbook.
